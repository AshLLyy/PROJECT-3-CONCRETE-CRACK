# PROJECT-3-CONCRETE-CRACK

This project about to clasify concretes with or without cracks by using AI with ResNet101V2 model. The model will perform classification task using data of the images. By using this project can save thousand of lives because from the cracks, can develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks whichoccur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happenwhen part of concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isnâ€™t compacted properly as well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. 

The dataset can get from link below.
